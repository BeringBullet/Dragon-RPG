<b>Game Summary:</b> Project “Dragon” is a Diablo style RPG with the absurd humour of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The game is set during the grubby phase of the medieval era when brave Sir Knights were bold and foolish and the unbathed peasants reeked of cabbage. As our unlikely, but cliched hero, you must triumph through the fabled lands of Persistence by battling monsters, finding ancient weapons, leveling up your character, venture to far off lands (using special Wizerd magik known as “meta-map fast-travel”), and seeking answers to the ultimate riddle - “Why are dragons such jerks?”
